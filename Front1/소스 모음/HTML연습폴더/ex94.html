            The House of Representatives took a pair of votes Monday night 
            with mixed results for the President: Conservatives joined Democrats 
            in voting to increase coronavirus stimulus checks, 
            but they also joined forces to override his veto of the massive defense spending bill, 
            a solid rebuke and sign of his waning power.

            Trump's dithering over the size of stimulus relief checks 
            has cost suffering Americans a week of more generous unemployment 
            -- but could also get them more generous relief checks. 
            The gobsmacking part is he had the power all along to insist on 
            larger checks and didn't, until it seemed too late. 
            He drew a line in the sand against his own negotiators 
            and got a few Republicans to cross it.
